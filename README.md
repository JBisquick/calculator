# How it's Made:

**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The calculator generates a string based on the input it receives. Once an operator or equal sign is pressed the calculator converts the string into float values, which are then calculated. Then they are returned to a string  that is displayed on the calculator screen.

# Lessons Learned: 

I gained knowledge on how to use key inputs. I gained a comprehensive understanding of how to use and sort functions.
